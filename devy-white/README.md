## devY white

devY White is an introduction course that introduces students to the cycle shell coding environment and basic Javascript concepts.

##### Concepts

- functions (read, return, parameters, create)
- variables (create, use, update)
  - strings
  - numbers
- string templates
- simple conditionals

### Project
Students demonstrate their knowledge of cycle-shell and these concepts to create a guess the number game.

##### Core Features

- [ ] **Check user guess**
  - Check to see if the user guessed the correct number and return an appropriate response.
  - *Skills learned:*
    - conditionals
    - parameters
    - return
    - strings
- [ ] **Store correct answer**
  - Create a variable and store the correct answer value
  - *Skills learned:*
    - variables
    - numbers
- [ ] **Track the number of guesses**
  - Keep track of the number of guesses that the user tries before finding the correct solution
  - *Skills learned:*
    - variables
    - incrementing numbers
- [ ] **Hints**
  - The game should supply the user with hints. The hint should be either "higher" or "lower" depending on the user's guess.
  - *Skills learned:*
    - conditionals
    - strings
    - functions
      - create
      - return
- [ ] **Set maximum number of guesses**
  - Create a maximum number of guesses. Once the user has reached the limit the game is over.
  - *Skills learned:*
    - variables
      - create
      - update
    - conditionals
- [ ] **Score**
  - The game should calculate a score for the user based on the number of guesses it took them to find the correct number
  - *Skills learned:*
    - variables
    - arithmetic
- [ ] **Get user name**
  - Get the name of the user before the game starts and use it to customize the messages throughout the game.
  - *Skills required:*
    - variables
      - create
      - update
    - string templates

##### Additional Features

- [ ] **Make correct answer a random number**
  - Use the random function to create a random number when the user starts a new game.
  - *Skills required:*
    - functions
      - call
    - variables
      - create
      - number
      - set
- [ ] **Reset**
  - Add the ability for the user to reset the game once the game has ended:
  - *Skills required*
    - variables
      - update
    - functions
      - create
      - call
      - return
- [ ] **Grades**
  - Grade the user based on the number of number of guesses and the number of attempts the user took.
  - *Skills required:*
    - conditionals
    - arithmetic
    - strings
    - functions
     - create
     - return
- [ ] **Set difficulty**
  - Create a way of the user setting the difficulty by changing: maximum number of tries, number range, score
  - *Skills required:*
    - functions
      - create
      - return
    - variables
      - update
      - numbers
