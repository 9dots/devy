# Adding Levels

##### Learning Goals

##### Overview
Begin with students talking in small groups to discuss what we learned last class, then teach the two new debugging tactics (syntax then concepts & isolating lines of code), and then work on building new rooms and expect that tutors will only help with debugging procedures.

### Explore
1. Review debugging procedures
2. Practice debugging logic mistakes
3. Move through the human version of the game
  - Make a point of what information the game current has to keep track of and keep a list of the variables on the whiteboard:
    - inventory
    - room
  - Every time the user inputs a command make sure to follow the main function and update the variable values
4. Move to a second room.
  - Ask students, "How are we keeping track of which room we are in?"
