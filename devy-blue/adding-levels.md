# Adding Levels

##### Learning Goals

##### Overview
Begin with students talking in small groups to discuss what we learned last class, then teach the two new debugging tactics (syntax then concepts & isolating lines of code), and then work on building new rooms and expect that tutors will only help with debugging procedures.

### Explore
1. Review debugging procedures
2. Practice debugging logic mistakes
3. Move through the human version of the game
  - Make a point of what information the game current has to keep track of and keep a list of the variables on the whiteboard:
    - inventory
    - room
  - Every time the user inputs a command make sure to follow the main function and update the variable values
4. Move to a second room.

### Questions
1. How are we keeping track of which room we are in?
2. How can you keep track of the next room in the object?
3. How can you use `currentRoom.next` to move to the next room?
4. How can you make sure that the student can't move to the next room until something else is completed?

### Engage
Students work on creating their multi-room games and add the ability to move between levels
