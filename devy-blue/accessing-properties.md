Debugging review with examples.

Discuss order:

### Explore
Create a human version of an object and if/else chain.  

1. Go through an example with if/else chain similar to the one students create in the previous lesson. Announce your steps out loud.
  1. Check the input
  2. Go to the if/else chain and check the noun
  3. If it is not the noun proceed to the next until you find the proper noun
  4. Once the proper one has been found walk over to the example object to find the description.
  5. Bring the description to the user.
2. Ask students, "Can you think of a better way to find the description?"
  - If students are having trouble, point out that the object already has a list of the available items.
3. Go through the example again, this time only checking the object.
  1. Check the input
  2. Go to the object
  3. If the input is there bring back the description

### Questions
1. Why is the checking the object important?
2. As your game gets bigger how many items do you think will be in the game?
3. Is it easier to check the list or create an if/else chain to check each word?
