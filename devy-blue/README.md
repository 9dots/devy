## devY blue

**prerequisites:** devY white

devY blue focuses on continued exploration of introductory Javascript concepts to create a more advanced web application in cycle-shell.

##### Concepts:
- variables
- objects
- complex conditionals
- functions (writing)
- debugging

##### Inspiration
Students create a text based game in [cycle-shell](http://cycle.sh). The inspiration for this project is the game Zork. Check out an online version [here](http://iplayif.com/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2Fzdungeon.z5) to see how the game works.

##### Project Document
Look at the [project document](devy-blue/escape-game.md) for more information on the order and structure of the game.
