# Sequence and function calls

### Explore
Students program teacher to create a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

Students write out the algorithm to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich using the functions:

- `getBread()`
- `getPeanutButter()`
- `spreadPeanutButter()`
- `getJelly()`
- `spreadJelly()`
- `eatSandwich()`
- `stackBread()`
- `cutSandwich()`

```
- To challenge students don’t write the functions in the correct order
- Make sure students add parentheses to the end of each function
- Act out the students instructions as they say them
```

Suggested Questions:


1. What made it hard to make the sandwich?
2. How did the order of your commands matter?

### Explain

1. In programming, the computer runs the instructions in order.
2. This is called sequencing. It means that the instructions run from top to bottom.
3. Instructions that perform a specific task are called functions.
4. Ask students to name the functions that Teacher robot knows.
5. What is the task of each function?
6. Ask students, “What special symbols did you notice are needed when calling a function?”
7. Students should notice that parentheses are required to call a function.
```
getPeanutButter()  -  Calls the function named getPeanutButter
getJelly() - Calls the function named getJelly
```
