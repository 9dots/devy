# devY

##### Recommended Grades
5th-8th

##### Mission
The goal of devY is to provide educators with the tools and curriculum to create a unique project based learning environment to teach coding. We believe that an offline exploration of concepts enhances student understanding, and engaging projects cement learning.

##### Tools
Using [requirebin](www.requirebin.com) and [cycle-shell](https://github.com/danleavitt0/simple-zork) students can interact with their computer in a terminal like environment. This allows students to build meaningful web applications with only and introductory knowledge of Javascript.
