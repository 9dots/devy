# devY

### Overview

##### Recommended Grades
5th-8th

##### Mission
The goal of devY is to provide educators with the tools and curriculum to create a unique project based learning environment to teach coding. We believe that an offline exploration of concepts enhances student understanding, and engaging projects cement learning.

### Unit structure
In each devY unit, students create a project that includes all of the concepts taught in the unit. The project is built in pieces, with each lesson mapping to a particular concept needed to create the larger project. Some lessons may take several classes to implement so the units are designed to let students move at their own pace.

### Lesson structure
devY lessons are composed of the following sections:

##### Explore
Students engage with the coding concept in an offline way.
##### Questions
Map explore exercise to Javascript concept.
##### Explain
Explicit instruction on how to implement the Javascript.
##### Engage
Use the new concept in a real word situation. During this time, students also break off to coding stations to review/reinforce learning of a particular concept.

### Tools
All of the platforms used in these lessons are 100% free.

##### cycle shell
Using [cycle shell](http://cycle.sh) students can interact with their computer in a terminal like environment. This allows students to build meaningful web applications with only and introductory knowledge of Javascript.

##### codewars (optional)
[Codewars](http://codewars.com) is an online platform where users solve real coding challenges. This curriculum utilizes codewars to reinforce concepts when students break out into coding stations.

##### weo (optional)
[Weo](http://weo.io) is an educational platform that makes it easy to create and grade assignments. The devY curriculum employs this to create quizzes and short review exercises.
