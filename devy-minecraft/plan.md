## Teaching order
1. Build sequentially
2. Build with functions
3. Build with loops
4. Mine with arrays

## Intro
1. Explain the goal of the class
  - Students are working to create a city, a theme park, and an automatic mining facility
  - In the city, each student has a plot of land that they can build their house on.
  - There is one catch: for 45 minutes per day, students will not be able to build directly. They need to use programmable turtle to do their building!
2. Introduce students to turtles.
  - Turtles are programmable Minecraft blocks that allow you to automate different Minecraft actions such as:
    - building
    - mining
    - crafting
    - and more!
  - Turtles are programmed in a language called **Lua**.
    - Lua is a scripting language like Javascript.
    - Lua is used in lots of games such as World of Warcraft and Angry Birds.
    - This means the concepts will be the same as your coding classes but the syntax, or how it is written, will be different.
  - To call functions in Lua simple write the name of the function and the add parentheses (just like Javascript)
3. Students login to Minecraft.
  - Show students their plot of land.
  - Explain that during the first 45 minutes of the lesson the only way that they will be able to build is by using the turtles.
  - For the second 35 minutes of the lesson students will be able to build as well as use their turtles to help out.
  - The expectation is that students will work on their own plot of land. Destruction of anything that does not belong to them will not be tolerated. Turtles can not leave their plot of land to protect against accidents.
  - Distribute the turtles to each student.
3. Show students how to interact with a turtle.
  - You need a remote to control the turtle. Once you have a remote right-click on the turtle you want to program.
  - You can use the remote to control the robot directly.
  - Show students the coding interface.
  - After adding code, students need to push the run button to make the robot run the code.
  - The undo button will reset the turtle back to where it started and undo everything from the last run.
4. Students test out turtles using the examples.
  - Students have 5 minutes to try out all of the example methods in the API. For example:
    - `turtle.forward()`
    - `turtle.back()`
    - `turtle.turnLeft()`
    - `turtle.digDown()`
5. Show students their movement challenges for the first day. When students finish a challenge, they raise their hand and have a tutor check their work to make sure that it functions correctly.

## Ideas

#### introduction
- introduce concepts
- predict novel code


#### debugging
- make turtle for predicting and debugging
- when predicting act out turtle movements using physical representation or body
- running turtle in first person viewpoint

#### presentation
- Present features out of order
- Add thumbnails
- Concepts needed for feature

#### when building  
- loop of
  - code
  - predict
  - observe
  - explain (what happened or didn't happen)
  - loop to start
- share out findings with build partner
- partner explains code back (or to tutor)

#### end of day sharing
- 2 or 3 students
- look at code


#### class timing
- code (intro new concept)
- turtle build
- student build
  - r & d
  - take notes on building process
- turtle build w/ new process
