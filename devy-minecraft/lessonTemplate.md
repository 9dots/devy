##### Learning Goals

##### Overview

### student mindset - 25 minutes
##### predict peer code - 5 minutes
Using the program of one of the students (from previous day) predict what the turtle will do.

##### introduce concept - 10 minutes
**Earn student interest for lesson**

Learn a new coding concept

###### predict novel code - 5 minutes
Predict output of sample code

### builder mindset - 10 minutes
Use turtles to build item from building challenges

##### plan with teammate - 5 minutes
1. Students get a partner or a group (2-3).
2. Each student in the group picks one building challenge. At the end of the day, each person in the group explains their code to the group.
3. Once students have successfully taught their group how their program works, they can share their code with them using the floppy disks (in game).
  - Successful teaching means that each of the members of the group can explain the code back to the group (or hopefully a tutor)

##### student build - 10 minutes
With building enabled, students create one of the building challenges. While building, students take notes on the procedures they used for their creation, and attempt to map that procedure list to code that the turtle can understand.

##### turtle build with new process - 25 minutes
Using their notes from the research time, student continue to work on their building challenge. When students are building, the process should be a loop of
  - code - create or revise the program.
  - predict - predict the outcome of the code using the physical representations.
  - observe - run the code in game and take notes on what happens using the worksheet.
  - explain
    - If it did not work:
      - Why did it not work?
      - What line do you think the problem is on?
      - What kind of mistake is it?
        - syntax
        - logic
      - What can you change to fix it?
      - Loop to start
    - If it did work:
      - Why does the code work now?
      - What was the most difficult part of this coding challenge?
      - What challenge are you going to work on next?


### teacher mindset - 10 minutes
Students show their partner the code that they have created during the lesson. The goal is to teach the code well enough that the partner can then turn around and explain the code to someone else.
