# building with turtles

##### Learning Goals
By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  - Call methods to control the turtle
  - Explain how to move the turtle

### introduction - 20 minutes

##### predict peer code - 5 minutes

##### introduce concept - 10 minutes
**Earn student interest for lesson**
Introduce students to turtles
  - Turtles are programmable Minecraft blocks that allow you to automate different Minecraft actions such as:
    - building
    - mining
    - crafting
    - and more!
  - Turtles are programmed in a language called **Lua**.
    - Lua is a scripting language like Javascript.
    - Lua is used in lots of games such as World of Warcraft and Angry Birds.
    - This means the concepts will be the same as your coding classes but the syntax, or how it is written, will be different.
  - To call functions in Lua simple write the name of the function and the add parentheses (just like Javascript)

##### predict novel code - 5 minutes
1. Students create their turtle cutout.
2. Show students the first code example. Students look at the code and use their cutout to predict what the code will do.
3. After students finish their predictions, run the code on the projector.
  ```ruby
  turtle.forward()
  turtle.turnLeft()
  turtle.forward()
  turtle.forward()
  ```
4. Discuss with students what happened and why.

##### plan with teammate - 5 minutes
1. Students get a partner or a group (2-3).
2. Each student in the group picks one building challenge. At the end of the day, each person in the group explains their code to the group.
3. Once students have successfully taught their group how their program works, they can share their code with them using the floppy disks (in game).
  - Successful teaching means that each of the members of the group can explain the code back to the group (or hopefully a tutor)

### turtle build - 10 minutes
1. Students join the Minecraft game a receive a turtle and turtle remote.
2. Show students how to interact with a turtle.
  - You need a remote to control the turtle. Once you have a remote right-click on the turtle you want to program.
  - You can use the remote to control the robot directly.
  - Show students the coding interface.
  - After adding code, students need to push the run button to make the robot run the code.
  - The undo button will reset the turtle back to where it started and undo everything from the last run.
3. Students test out turtles using the examples.
  - Students have 5 minutes to try out all of the example methods in the API. For example:
    - `turtle.forward()`
    - `turtle.back()`
    - `turtle.turnLeft()`
    - `turtle.digDown()`
4. Students work on the building challenge they selected.

### student build - 10 minutes
With building enabled, students create one of the building challenges. While building, students take notes on the procedures they used for their creation, and attempt to map that procedure list to code that the turtle can understand.

### turtle build with new process - 25 minutes
Using their notes from the research time, student continue to work on their building challenge. When students are building, the process should be a loop of
  - code - create or revise the program.
  - predict - predict the outcome of the code using the physical representations.
  - observe - run the code in game and take notes on what happens using the worksheet.
  - explain
    - If it did not work:
      - Why did it not work?
      - What line do you think the problem is on?
      - What kind of mistake is it?
        - syntax
        - logic
      - What can you change to fix it?
      - Loop to start
    - If it did work:
      - Why does the code work now?
      - What was the most difficult part of this coding challenge?
      - What challenge are you going to work on next?

### share with partner / tutor - 10 minutes
Students show their partner the code that they have created during the lesson. The goal is to teach the code well enough that the partner can then turn around and explain the code to someone else (tutor).
